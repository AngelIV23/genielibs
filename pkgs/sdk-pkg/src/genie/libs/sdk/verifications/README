A verification is the execution of a command to retrieve the current state of a
device. Verifications could be show commands, YANG, xml, REST, and so on.

Verifications are of two types: Global and Local.

Global Verifications are first run right after the common setup. At this stage,
the information retrieved is saved as a snapshot. After each consequent trigger
the same set of verifications are executed again, and their state is compared
to the previously taken snapshot.

Local verifications are indepedent of the Global verifications. They are run as
subsections of a trigger. A first set of snapshots are taken before performing
the trigger action. A second set of snapshots are taken after the trigger
action and then compared to the first set of snapshots.
