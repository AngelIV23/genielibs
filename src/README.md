Source Code Shortcuts
=====================


This folder is intended to provide a shortcut directory structure to editors,
so that all packages appear as straight-up python packages.

This folder only contains symlinks to actual code source locations, similar to
how `tests/` folder operates.


> the actual codes are under `pkgs/*-pkgs/src/genie`.

> if you are creating a new package, add its source code folder here for
  ease of access.
