A trigger is a set of action and verifications that collectively constitute a
testcase. These actions can include removal/addition of configuration, flapping
protocols/interfaces, perform HA events, and any other actions that can be
performed to test your devices. Triggers can also include verifications that
check the above actions were correctly peformed on the devices. We call those
local verifications.
